## Getting started

**commitizen-emoji** allows you to easily use emojis in your commits with [commitizen].


**Why?**


According to the [Telegraph],
the average human attention span has recently dropped from 🙈 12 seconds to
8 seconds, docking us below that of a goldfish. Developers are much less likely
to read thoroughly the whole commit message of every file, when there are 
📄 pages of a codebase itself. Reading even a single commit message requires
a maximum of a few seconds of focus per file. And we all know, that 🔥 wasting
an engineer's time is an unacceptable luxury.


Emojis satisfy this desire for fast and efficient scanning of the commit history
across files. There are several advantages that emojis bring:


##### 📌 they're small *key text anchors* 

Emojis are a sequence of one or more code points that are displayed as a grapheme.


##### 🧐 they're *eye-catching*

Compare two pictures below.

A dull formal text looks pale next to a shiny emoji star ✨. Wait till you see a 
git log or blame a file...


##### 📸 they're *recognizable*

Like really! You will definitely understand that this ⚡️ means performance
improvement, and this 🐛 means a bug fix. You can even choose one of supported
emoji packs to get around with a fixed and a relatively small amount of well
recognized emojis, like a [conventional] pack;


##### 📈 they're *growing in  numbers*

You will always find a desired emoji for your needs.


##### they're *fun* 🎉 and *fancy* 💄!


## Demo 
```sh
? Select the type of change you're committing:  (Use arrow keys or type to search)
❯ codestyle   🎨  Improve structure / format of the code.
  perf        ⚡️  Improve performance.
  prune       🔥  Remove code or files.
  bugfix      🐛  Fix a bug.
  hotfix      🚑️  Critical hotfix.
  feature     ✨  Introduce new features.
  docs        📝  Add or update documentation.

# Other prompts and answers...
```

```sh
# Resulting commit title (with conventional set to false)
✨ (nonconventional): no type specified only emoji and scope

# Resulting commit title (with conventional set to true)
✨ feature(conventional): type comes with emoji and scope
```

## Installation

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> Keep it local =)

```sh
yarn add -D commitizen commitizen-emoji

# set as default adapter for your projects
echo '{ "path": "./node_modules/commitizen-emoji" }' > ./.czrc
```

OR add this to your package.json

```json
  "config": {
    "commitizen": {
      "path": "./node_modules/commitizen-emoji"
    }
  },
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn cz
```

OR if [husky] hooks are set up

```sh
# if commit-msg hook contains commitlint scripts
# 'a' will be neglected after commitlint checks commit
# message prepared by commitizen
git commit -m 'a'

# if commit-msg hook is not enabled
yarn cz
```

## Customization

Configuring **commitizen-emoji** can be done in two equal ways:

I. `package.json`
```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {}
  }
}
```
II. `./.czrc`
```sh
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {}
  }
}
```

## Configuration Options

#### types

By default **commitizen-emoji** comes preconfigured with the [Gitmoji] types
and an author's version of type names.


But you always can declare your own set of types in the manner of gitmoji types.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> Make sure your codes match with markdown emoji codes

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "types": [
         {
           "emoji": "😱",
           "code": ":scream:",
           "description": "I don't understand a bit in all this code.",
           "name": "wtf"
         }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```


#### replaceTypes

Should custom user types replace default gitmoji types.


Defaults to `false` - types will be merged.


User types will take precedence over default types, or renamed types.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> This option will have no effect if types array is not defined or empty

```json
"commitizenEmoji": {
  "types": [
      {
        "emoji": "😱",
        "code": ":scream:",
        "description": "I don't understand a bit in all this code.",
        "name": "wtf"
      }
  ],
  "replaceTypes": true
}
```


#### scopes

List of custom user scopes.


Defaults to an empty array.


Affects the way the prompt behaves. If there are scopes, the prompt will 
suggest to select a scope instead of typing it.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "scopes": ["linters", "accounts", "tdd", "ci", "fixtures"]
    }
  }
}
```


#### symbol

Should emoji be depicted as a grapheme or as a code.


Defaults to `false` - code.


> 🚩 **Note**
>
> Some terminals (e.g., Windows terminal) cannot substitute a code
> with a grapheme, so it helps to show an emoji correctly in your terminal.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "symbol": true
    }
  }
}
```


#### skipQuestions

List of question that must be skipped by the prompt.


Defaults to an empty array.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "skipQuestions": ["scope", "body", "breakingBody", "issues"]
    }
  }
}
```


#### questions

User defined question for each prompt.


Defaults to an object with original questions.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "questions": {
        "type": "This will be displayed instead of original type question",
        "scope": "This will be displayed instead of original scope question",
        "subject": "This will be displayed instead of original subject question",
        "body": "This will be displayed instead of original body question",
        "breakingBody": "This will be displayed instead of original breakingBody question",
        "issues": "This will be displayed instead of original issues question"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


#### subjectMaxLength

Maximum length of the subject.


Defaults to `75`.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> Make sure [commitlint] (if enabled) is configured to accept this length
> of a commit title

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "subjectMaxLength": 200
    }
  }
}
```


#### issuesPrefix

Inserts prefix to all listed issues, .e.g. 
```sh
# Issues: 2, 3 becomes
Issues: https://harbarfor.atlassian.net/browse/2, https://harbarfor.atlassian.net/browse/3.
```
Defaults to an empty string.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> URL validation is done by [URL node module], so make sure your prefix conform 
> to validation rules of this module.
>
>
> Any string can be used as a prefix

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "issuesPrefix": "https://harbarfor.atlassian.net/browse/"
    }
  }
}
```


#### conventionalFormat

Should the title contain an emoji with its name, in order to 
pass commit linters (e.g., commitlint), or to please your preferences.


Defaults to `false` - name is not added.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "conventionalFormat": true
    }
  }
}
```


#### selectedTypesByCode

List of **gitmoji** types that user wants to work with.
Types are picked by emoji codes.


Defaults to an empty array - all **gitmoji** types are used.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> If replaceTypes option is set to true, this list is neglected.
>
> If usePack option is provided and types option is not, this list is neglected.
>
> All nonexistant code name will be ignored

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "selectedTypesByCode": [":art:", ":memo:", ":sparkles:", ":bug:"]
    }
  }
}
```


#### typeNamesByCode

Map of code-name pairs.

Allows to redefine emoji names by selecting them by a gitmoji code
and giving them new names.


You can examine [default code-name pairs].

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> If types are provided and replaceTypes is set to true, this map is neglected.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "typeNamesByCode": {
         ":fire:": "cowabunga",
         ":poop:": "it-is-treason-then"
       }
    }
  }
}
```


#### usePack

Allows to use one of the most popular sets of types.


Defaults to an empty string - standard gitmoji types are used.


Each set comes with appropriate names and emojis, that are opinionated.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> If types are provided, this option is neglected.

```json
{
  "config": {
    "commitizenEmoji": {
      "usePack": "conventional"
    }
  }
}
```
